# ðŸ§  Aidea ðŸ§ 

An application to allow people to suggest and join forces on ideas for new projects within an organization.

## Stack

- **React**
- **API**
- **Storage**
- **Hosting**
- **Authentication**
- **Jest** for testing
- **GitHub Actions** for CI and CD

## Configuration

The structure of this application was built upon an *ejected* **create-react-app**.
After this, other modifications where made in order to provide for a more enjoyable 
and productive developer experience while developing applications with this template:

### Import alias
Using `/../....` to import modules above and outside a particular module can be quite
an annoying experience. For this reason changes were made in order to allow for `@aidea/<path>`
to be used when importing modules.

#### Configurations
- `jsconfig.json`
- `config/webpack.config.js`
- `eslint` config in package.json
- `jest` config in package.json
